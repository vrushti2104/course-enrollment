# Course Enrollment Platform

This repository contains a simple **Course Enrollment Platform** built using **Laravel 9**. The platform allows instructors to create and manage courses, and students to enroll in and track their progress through courses. It is a basic, scalable system designed for educational platforms that require course management, lesson creation, and progress tracking.

## Features

- **Profile:** Students can view the courses they have enrolled in on their profile page.

### 2. **Courses**
- **Create Courses:** Instructors can create and manage courses, including adding cover images, titles, and descriptions.
- **Course Structure:** Each course contains multiple lessons or modules, each with its own title, description, and content.

### 3. **Course Enrollment**
- **Browse Courses:** Students can browse all available courses.
- **Enroll:** Students can enroll in any course and access its lessons/modules.
- **Enrollment Status:** Students can see the status of their enrollment in various courses.

### 4. **Course Progress Tracking**
- **Lesson Progress:** Students can view a list of completed and remaining lessons/modules for each course they are enrolled in.
- **Dashboard:** Students can track their overall progress within a course on their personal dashboard.

### 5. **Instructor Management**
- **Course Management:** Instructors can create, update, and delete courses.
- **Lesson Management:** Instructors can manage the lessons/modules within a course, adding and editing lessons as necessary.
